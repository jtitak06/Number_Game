**My Process**

This project is a number game which challenges players to guess a number between 1-100 in as few guesses as possible. The first step to build this project was to create the HTML and CSS. I wanted to create a light color gradient background. To test a few different combinations, I used an online gradient editor to seek a style that I liked.

The next part of this project was to create the JavaScript. I started with the basic functionality aspect and then proceeded to other features that were not necessary to making the game work, but did enhance the user's experience. The first task was to code a random number for the console between 1-100. I did this by utilizing the Math.floor() and Math.random() method. Once the number was correctly logged in the console, I needed to make sure the input field and buttons worked. After the input field and buttons worked, I then proceeded to add some additional features. These additional features include a guess counter, timer, and feedback section.

After you successfully guess the correct number, I also added a confetti feature to help the player celebrate their victory. For the confetti feature, I watched a YouTube video on how to add and implement this into the Number Game. This was also fun and made the game unique.
